"""
Given a NxM matrix of integers containing duplicate elements. The task is to find the sum of all minimum occurring elements in the given matrix. That is the sum of all such elements whose frequency is even in the matrix.

Examples:

Input : mat[] = {{1, 1, 2},
                {2, 3, 3},
                {4, 5, 3}}
Output : 9
The min occurring elements are 4, 5 and they 
occurs only 1 time.
Therefore, sum = 4+5 = 9

Input : mat[] = {{10, 20},
                 {40, 40}}
Output : 30
