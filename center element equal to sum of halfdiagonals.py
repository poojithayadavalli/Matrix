"""
Given a matrix of odd order i.e(5*5). Task is to check if the center element of the matrix is equal to the individual sum of all the half diagonals.



Examples:

Input : mat[][] = {   2   9   1   4  -2
                      6   7   2  11   4
                      4    2  9   2   4
                      1   9   2    4  4
                      0   2   4    2  5 } 
Output :Yes
Explanation : 
Sum of Half Diagonal 1 = 2 + 7 = 9
Sum of Half Diagonal 2 = 9 + 0 = 9
Sum of Half Diagonal 3 = 11 + -2 = 9
Sum of Half Diagonal 4 = 5 + 4 = 9

Here, All the sums equal to the center element
that is mat[2][2] = 9
