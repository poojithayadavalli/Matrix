"""
Given an array arr[] of positive integers, the task is to find the minimum steps to reduce all the elements to 0. In a single step, -1 can be added to all the non-zero elements of the array at the same time.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = {1, 5, 6}
Output: 6
Operation 1: arr[] = {0, 4, 5}
Operation 2: arr[] = {0, 3, 4}
Operation 3: arr[] = {0, 2, 3}
Operation 4: arr[] = {0, 1, 2}
Operation 5: arr[] = {0, 0, 1}
Operation 6: arr[] = {0, 0, 0}

Input: arr[] = {1, 1}
Output: 1
