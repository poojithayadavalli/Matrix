"""
Given a matrix mat[][], pair of indices X and Y, the task is to find the number of moves to bring all the non-zero elements of the matrix to the given cell at (X, Y). 
 

A move consists of moving an element at any cell to its four directional adjacent cells i.e., left, right, top, bottom. 
 

Examples: 
 

Input: mat[][] = {{1, 0}, {1, 0}}, X = 1, Y = 1 
Output: 3 
Explanation: 
Moves required => 
For Index (0, 0) => 2 
For Index (1, 0) => 1 
Total moves required = 3
Input: mat[][] = {{1, 0, 1, 0}, {1, 1, 0, 1}, {0, 0, 1, 0}}, X = 1, Y = 3 
Output: 13
