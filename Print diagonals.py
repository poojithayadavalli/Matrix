"""
Given a 2D square matrix, the task is to print the Principal and Secondary diagonals of this matrix in O(N) time complexity. For O(N2) time, please refer this article.

Examples :

Input: 
4
1 2 3 4
4 3 2 1
7 8 9 6
6 5 4 3
Output:
Principal Diagonal: 1, 3, 9, 3
Secondary Diagonal: 4, 2, 8, 6

Input:
3
1 1 1
1 1 1
1 1 1
Output:
Principal Diagonal: 1, 1, 1
Secondary Diagonal: 1, 1, 1
