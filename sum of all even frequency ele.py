"""
Given a NxM matrix of integers containing duplicate elements. The task is to find the sum of all even occurring elements in the given matrix. That is the sum of all such elements whose frequency is even in the matrix.

Examples:

Input : mat[] = {{1, 1, 2},
                {2, 3, 3},
                {4, 5, 3}}
Output : 18
The even occurring elements are 1, 2 and their number
of occurrences are 2, 2 respectively. Therefore,
sum = 1+1+2+2 = 6.

Input : mat[] = {{10, 20},
                 {40, 40}}
Output : 80
