"""
Given an array arr[] of N elements, the task is to find the product of the elements which have prime frequencies in the array. Since, the product can be large so print the product modulo 109 + 7. Note that 1 is neither prime nor composite.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = {5, 4, 6, 5, 4, 6}
Output: 120
All the elements appear 2 times which is a prime
So, 5 * 4 * 6 = 120

Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3}
Output: 6
Only 2 and 3 appears prime number of times i.e. 3 and 5 respectively.
So, 2 * 3 = 6
